        <p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client, and any general-purpose programming language in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client and server. <br>
            For example, to develop a web application, the architect defines the stack as the target operating system, web server, database, and programming language. Another version of a software stack is operating system, middleware, database, and applications.[2] Regularly, the components of a software stack are developed by different developers independently from one another.

            Some components/subsystems of an overall system are chosen together often enough that the particular set is referred to by a name representing the whole, rather than by naming the parts. Typically, the name is an acronym representing the individual components.[3]
            
            The term "solution stack" has, historically, occasionally included hardware components as part of a final product, mixing both the hardware and software in layers of support.[4][5]
            
            A full-stack developer is expected to be able to work in all the layers of the web development. A full-stack web developer can be defined as a developer or an engineer who works with both the front and back end development of a website or web application.[6] This means they can lead platform builds that involve databases, user-facing websites, and working with clients during the planning phase of projects </p>
